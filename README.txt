We designed the basic architecture of the system with the algorithm for FFT from pa4 as follows: we have one GPU thread block assigned for computation of each row (or column depending on whether we are doing the row or column fourier transform computation). Further, we assign one thread in each thread block to do all relevant computations for one pixel of the image. Hence if we have a 512x512 image, we will have 512 thread blocks with 512 threads per thread block. 

We have five device-level kernels (called by the host) corresponding roughly to the methods: cpu_fftx, cpu_ifftx, cpu_ffty, cpu_iffty, and cpu_filter from pa4. 

Our current architecture achieves a roughly 300x speedup on image 3. The correctness is verified by the fact that a human cannot decipher the difference between the reference solution image and that generated by our implementation.
